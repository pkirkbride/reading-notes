## Learning markdown

I'm learning how to use Markdown on my github pages and have a few key concepts to share with my readers. Markdown is a quick way to format pages with syntax that's relatively easy to remember and quick to type.

This isn't just for github, by the way. Many applications undesrtand Markdown and will add some pizzazz to your day. Here are some examples of what you can do.

- **Make text bold**
- *Italicize text*
 
- ### Create a header
 

You can do this by adding special characters while you type. This is what the text above looks like before your browser works its magic.

> `- **Make text bold**`
> 
> `- *Italicize text*`
> 
> `- ### Create a header`

It's a lot to remember at first, but eventually, it'll become second nature. While you're learning, here's a good reference guide.
