## Learning markdown

Markdown is a quick yet robust way to format text with syntax that's relatively easy to remember and quick to type. Nearly all applications that support Markdown can handle the basic formatting options that will cover most users' needs. Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.

- **Make text bold**
- *Italicize text*
 
- ### Create a header
 

This works by adding special characters to your text. This is what the text above looks like before Markdown works its magic.

```
- **Make text bold**
 
- *Italicize text*
 
- ### Create a header
```

It's a lot to remember at first, but eventually, it'll become second nature. While you're learning, here's a good reference guide.
