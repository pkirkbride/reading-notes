Markdown is a quick way to format pages with syntax that's relatively easy to remember and quick to type. Nearly all applicatiions that support Markdown can handle the basic formatting optoins that will cover most users' needs. Here are some basic examples of what you can do wiht Markdown.

- **Make text bold**
- *Italicize text*
 
- ### Create a header
 

This works by adding special characters to your text. This is what the text above looks like before Markdown works its magic.

```
- **Make text bold**
 
- *Italicize text*
 
- ### Create a header
```
