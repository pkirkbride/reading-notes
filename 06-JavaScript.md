# Read: 06 - Dynamic web pages with Java script

## Java Script

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language commonly used for web pages. It is not to be confused with the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) programming language.

One use of JavaScript on a web page is to collect input from the user and use that input to create output.

_Variables_ are essentially a way to store values. There are four ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

- `Var` - is useful in that it works on older browsers
- `Let` - is used for a variable that may change
- `Const` - is used for a variable that cannot change
- Using nothing

JavaScript variables in a script must all have unique names called _identifiers_. It is important to name variables in a meaningful way. That will make it more intuitive to keep track as the number of variables in your script grows.

There are a few rules to remember when naming variables.

- Names must begin with a letter, $, or \_
- Names can contain letters, digits, $, or \_
- Words representing JavaScript functions cannot be used
- Names are case sensitive

Variables can be assigned at the same time that they are declared or they can be assigned at a later time \(e.g. based on a value that will be calculated later\). It is a good idea to declare all of your variables at the beginning of the script.

Anything in quotes will be treated as a _string_. This means that you can perform a calculation with 5 but not “5” when they are used as variables.

## How computers work

Here are my key takeways from the code.org video series on how computer work.

The underlying factors that make a computer a computer are that they do the following four things:

2. Receive input
2. Store data
2. Process data
2. Create output

At the heart of the computer is the CPU. It processes huge numbers of calculations extremely quickly. This is what allows us to do increasingly more complicated things with computer hardware.

The opeating system is the master program that controls the other software on the computer.
