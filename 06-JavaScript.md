# Read: 06 - Dynamic web pages with Java script

JavaScript (JS) is a programming language commonly used for web pages. It is not to be confused with the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) programming language.

One use of JavaScript on a web page is to collect input from the user and use it to create output.

Variables are essentially a way to store values. There are four ways to declare a JavaScript variable:

- `Var` - is useful only in that it works on older browsers
- `Let` - is used for a variable that may change
- `Const` - is used for a constant that will not change
-Using nothing

JavaScript variables in a script must all have unique names called identifiers. It is important to name variables in a meaningful way. That will make it more intuitive to keep track as the number of variables in your script grows.

There are a few rules to remember when naming variables.

-Names must begin with a letter, $, or \_
-Names can contain letters, digits, $, or \_
-Words representing JavaScript functions cannot be used
-Names are case sensitive

Variables can be assigned at the same time that they are declared or they can be assigned at a later time \(e.g. based on a value that will be calculated later\). It’s a good idea to declare all of your variables at the beginning of the script.

Anything in quotes will be treated as a string. This means that you can perform a calculation with 5 but not “5” when they are used as variables.
