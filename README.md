# Growth mindset

A key trait to develop when learning a new skill is a *growth mindset*. A growth mindset views the ability to learn as a skill that can be developed rather than an innate and unchanging characteristic.

Here are some examples of a growth mindset.

- **Challenges** are viewed as a learning opportunity instead of a thing to be avoided.
- **Setbacks** are met with persistance rather than giving up.
- **Criticism** is treated as valuable feedback to learn from rather than ignored.
