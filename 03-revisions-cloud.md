Git is a version control system that allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time. It’s a distributed version control system. This means that  the repositories are mirrored on all users’ computers, so if one is lost or corrupted, another one can be used in its place.

Files in Git can be in three states: *committed*, *modified*, and *staged*.

- Committed means that they are the current version of the document securely stored in the local database.

- Modified means that the file has been changed but not moved to the local database.

- Staged means that the file will be included the next time files are committed to the database.

Another feature is that Git can copy from remote repositories, such as GitHub. So you can store something on GitHub to share with everyone while working on a copy on your own computer. Once you’re ready to share your changes, you can push them to the remote repository.
