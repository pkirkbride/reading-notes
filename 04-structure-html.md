## Wireframe and design

Designing a website usually starts with developing a wireframe. Wireframes are high-level plans for information hierarchy on a website or app. They are a way to plan the overall layout of an interface.

It may be a good idea to work with hand-drawn wire frames initially because they are easy to change and can be used right away to get user feedback. Once the design is largely established, then switching to a software wireframe could make sense to track more minute changes.

Another key step is to map out user flow so that you know where the users are coming from and where they are going on the site. This step will help define how many different pages you need, what content they should have, and how they are related.

Draft and sketch. Donâ€™t get too lost in the details (e.g. colors, aesthetics). Only after  the draft is complete should you add some detail.
