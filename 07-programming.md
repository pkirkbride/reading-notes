## Control Flow

_Control flow_ is the order that the computer handles a script. Generally, this is from top to bottom. But there are exceptions within the script that can change the order of the flow. One example is `if … else` statements. Depending on the condition that’s found, the flow may go down a different path or restart altogether. Another common example is loops that repeat an action as long as it’s necessary to fully complete the script.

## Functions

_Functions_ in JavaScript are sections of code that perform a particular task. A benefit to using functions is that they allow you to write code once that can be reused as much as needed.

A function is _invoked_, or started, differently depending on the situation.

- When an event occurs like a user clicking submit
- When it’s invoked in the code
- Automatically

A _return_ statement stops executing a function.

## Variables and functions

Functions can be used as variables. So if you have a function called myFunction(), you could use it like this.
let x = myFunction()

It’s also possible to set a variable that only works in the function, which is called a local variable. It won’t work anywhere in the script outside the function.

## JavaScript operators

JavaScript operators will look familiar to people with basic knowledge of math. But the exact way the work within JavaScript is slightly different. Here are some common operators.

| Type | Symbol |
| Assignment | = |
| Addition | + |
| Multiplication | - |
| Division | / |
| Division with remainder | % |
